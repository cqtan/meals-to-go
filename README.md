## Setup

### expo

- Easily run apps on ios or android devices virtually / or on device itself
- npm install -g expo-cli → expo init (app-name)
- Can run either in ios or android mode

### iOS

- Simply have Xcode installed and updated and expo should pick it up

### Android

- To configure an Android emulator phone, e.g. Pixel 4
- On start screen → configure (right bottom) → AVD Manager → Create and Run phone
- Only then run the expo app

### ESLint + Prettier config

- Using React-Native-Community Config [here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-react-native-community#readme)
